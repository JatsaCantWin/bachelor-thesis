\chapter{The needs of an energy cluster}
\label{ch:background}

\par An \textbf{Energy Cluster}, is a group of institutions and businesses that work together to produce, exchange, and distribute electrical energy. These clusters allow smaller agents on the energy market to cooperate and pool their resources in order to make their energy infrastructure safer, more efficient, and more profitable. Energy clusters typically include mid-sized enterprises, smaller individual energy plants, and non-profit organizations, but they can also include larger institutions that are dedicated solely to generating electricity. This arrangement allows these entities to to get more favorable deals when selling electricity back to the grid. 
\par Energy clusters also help to promote the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power\citep{Uwarunkowania1}\citep{Uwarunkowania2}\citep{WoznyMasters}.
